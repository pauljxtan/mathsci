========
Python modules for computational science and mathematics. For personal education and amusement, only standard library modules are used, and clarity is greatly emphasized over performance. Absolutely not meant for serious applications -- one would certainly prefer numpy/scipy/etc. to my dreadfully inefficient routines.

### Modules ###
* __constants__: various physical constants
* __datatypes__: generic datatypes
* __utils__: miscellaneous utility functions
* __math__: the mathematical framework
    * __linalg__: fundamental linear algebra operations
